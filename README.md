# PHOTON
Please Help, Optical Thinking Overclocked - Noah

## Overview

PHOTON is an open initiative aimed at revolutionizing neural computation through photonic hardware. By leveraging the inherent advantages of light-based systems - such as speed, parallelism, and energy efficiency - PHOTON seeks to develop scalable, low-power optical neural networks that can outperform traditional electronic counterparts.

## Why It Matters

Most AI runs on massive GPUs that burn kilowatts of energy and cost thousands of dollars. PHOTON does it differently:

* **No silicon-based compute**
* **No matrix math bottlenecks**
* **No active cooling**
* Just light, filter, and *physics*

## Key Features

* **Photonic Neurons:** Utilizes light polarization and intensity to simulate neuron behavior, enabling rapid and efficient computations.
* **Scalability:** Designs support stacking multiple layers, allowing for complex neural network architectures.
* **Energy Efficiency:** Reduces power consumption by orders of magnitude compared to conventional digital processing.
* **Open-Source Tools:** Provides schematics, simulations, and software tools for community collaboration and development.

## Status

PHOTON is in **early prototyping**

We're currently testing:

* Faint-laser driven neuron behavior
* LC-based weight control
* Optical-to-digital inference via CMOS sensors
* Layer stacking and polarization behaviors

## Goals

* Create a proof-of-concept optical neuron
* Demonstrate 1-layer inference from light input to CMOS output
* Publish fully documented demo hardware and software
* Build towards a stackable, scalable, open hardware photonic AI core
