# PHOTON: Theoretical Foundations

**Please Help, Optical Thinking Overclocked - Noah**

## Introduction

PHOTON is an optical neural processing architecture that leverages the physical properties of light—polarization, interference, attenuation, and detection—to perform massively parallel inference at ultra-low power and near light-speed.

This document outlines the core theoretical principles that make PHOTON possible and highlights the disruptive potential of photonic computation for artificial intelligence and simulation workloads.

## 1. Core Premise

Instead of simulating neural behavior using digital logic (e.g. matrix multiplication on GPUs), PHOTON  physically implements neural computation in the optical domain using layers of liquid crystal displays (LCDs), polarizers, and CMOS sensors. Each pixel functions as a probabilistic neuron.

* **Input:** Encoded as modulated light (polarization, color, or intensity)
* **Processing:** Layered LCDs adjust polarization/phase/color values to represent weights.
* **Output:** CMOS sensor detects intensity and color patterns as neuron activation.

## 2. Optical Neuron Design

Each optical neuron is modeled by the transformation of a single photon (or beam of photons) through a sequence of optical elements:

* **Polarizer:** Establishes initial polarization state.
* **Liquid Crystal (LC):** Applies a voltage-tunable rotation to polarization (acts as the weight)
* **Second Polarizer (Analyzer, optional):** Converts polarization angle into intensity (via Malus' Law)
* **CMOS Detector:** Measures final light intensity, position, and/or color (interpreted as activation value)

The output is inherently probabilistic and physical.

## 3. Parallelism and Speed

Each pixel acts independently and simultaneously:

* In a 4K LCD panel (~8.3 million pixels), this yields 8.3 million optical neurons firing in parallel.
* Layers can be stacked to increase network depth - each stack is a feedforward layer.
* Inference occurs at the speed of light through the medium (~nanoseconds)

Compared to a GPU that processes matrix operations sequentially across thousands of cores, PHOTON executes a forward pass instantly, limited only by light propagation and CMOS readout.

## 4. Learning and Training

Due to the inherent probabilistic nature of the system, training can potentially be faster than traditional neural networks. The model can be optimized to match the physical characteristics of the optical system itself, reducing the need for precision and physics-heavy modeling. 

## 5. Power and Efficiency

* Low current draw during computation
* Only power consumed is:
  * LCD voltage control (uW per pixel)
  * Backlight or coherent light source
  * CMOS sensor readout

Power consumption per inference is orders of magnitude below electronic counterparts, especially for large models.

## 6. Scalability

* Each LCD Layer = ~2-33M neurons (1080p to 8k)
* Stack 10-100 layers = massive model capacity
* Input/output can be handled optically (via LCD modulation) or digitally (via CMOS translation)

## 7. Applications

* Language model inference (GPT, LLaMa, etc.)
* Vision processing
* Embedded low-power AI (drones, satellites, wearables)
* High-speed physical simulation (fluid, weather, protein folding)
* Analog neural emulation

## Conclusion

PHOTON redefines the boundaries of neural computation by discarding silicon's limitations and embracing nature's fastest and most efficient medium—light. This system is not only viable with commodity components, but scalable, manufacturable, and deployable today.
